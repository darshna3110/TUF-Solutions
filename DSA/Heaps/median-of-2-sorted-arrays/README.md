## 📝 Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size m and n respectively, return the **median** of the two sorted arrays.

The median is defined as the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. In case the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

### Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [2, 4, 6], arr2 = [1, 3, 5]

Output: 3.5

Explanation: The array after merging arr1 and arr2 will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]. As the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Here two medians are 3 and 4. So the median will be the average of 3 and 4, which is 3.5.

### Example 2:

Input: arr1 = [2, 4, 6], arr2 = [1, 3]

Output: 3.0

Explanation: The array after merging arr1 and arr2 will be [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 ]. The median is simply 3.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 0 <= m <= 1000
- 0 <= n <= 1000
- 1 <= m + n <= 2000
- -10^6 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^6
